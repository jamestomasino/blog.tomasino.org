![The case for faith][]

Lee Strobel's book shows a heavy influence from his time as a
journalist, an influence he makes no attempt to deny or diminish. This
book, like his others in his "The Case for..." series, relies heavily
upon the reasoning and logical deduction he learned as a reporter with
the Chicago Tribune. So it came as no surprise when he logically ordered
the interviews and chapters around eight organizing questions, or "The
Big 8" as he calls them. These questions represent to Mr. Strobel the
most convincing arguments against faith in Christianity.

1.  If there's a loving God, why does this pain-wracked world groan
    under so much suffering and evil?
2.  If the miracles of God contradict science, then how can any rational
    person believe that they're true?
3.  If God is morally pure, how can he sanction the slaughter of
    innocent children as the Old Testament says he did?
4.  If God cares about the people he created, how could he consign so
    many of them to an eternity of torture in hell just because they
    didn't believe the right things about him?
5.  If Jesus is the only way to heaven, then what about the millions of
    people who have never heard of him?
6.  If God really created the universe, why does the evidence of science
    compel so many to conclude that the unguided process of evolution
    accounts for life?
7.  If God is the ultimate overseer of the church, why has it been rife
    with hypocrisy and brutality throughout the ages?
8.  If I'm still plagued by doubts, then is it still possible to be a
    Christian?

As a journalist as his core, Mr. Strobel doesn't seek to answer these
questions on his own, or even summarize other answers from journals,
periodicals, and books. He interviews experts in the christian community
who have particular familiarity with each question. The author then
becomes a voice of the questioner, the doubter, and at times the
atheist, who argues against Christianity with the sense of truth that
comes from a person who was indeed once an atheist himself.

The authors antidotes about his own path to faith and the parallels he
shared with the book he is authoring is a helpful guide and a binding
force to what might have otherwise been disjointed apologetic interviews
with top christian leaders. As the organizing questions keep the book on
target, Lee's own sub-plot of searching for answers keeps the book
together as a unit.

I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for help in their
own faith journey. It is not, however, a book of solid apologetics to be
brandished at the nearest atheist in hopes of conversion. There are
plenty of mixed messages inside, including a strong position that those
who don't want to believe will not believe. Overall, the author makes
excellent points that "the Big 8" lose their venom when tackled one by
one, and when taken as a whole, the evidence for faith is overwhelming.

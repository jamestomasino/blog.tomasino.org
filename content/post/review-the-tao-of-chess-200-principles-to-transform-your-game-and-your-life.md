My rating: [1 of 5 stars][]

I love eastern philosophy. I really love chess. One would figure that
this book would hit some magical combo-zone and have me praising and
sharing it with all my friends. Unfortunately, The Tao of Chess fails on
the most important parts.

I'll admit it, the premise is fantastic. I've felt for a while that
chess carries enough complexity to warrant numerous metaphors worthy of
contemplation. In fact, I've already begun picking apart aspects of
chess to use as a martial arts structure in my novel. Perhaps this is
the same line of thinking that lead Peter Kurzdorfer to write this book.
Honestly, I think the idea can work well, he just didn't pull it off
here.

You see, Mr. Kurzdorfer writes as a man who knows his chess aphorisms
well, as a player who can show you games to illustrate a point, as a
Master of the game. What he does not do is write as a student of Tao.

Each of the 200 chess "principles" is followed by a short explanation.
Often he cites a game to illustrate the reasoning behind it. Finally,
the author gives us a sentence or two attempting to connect the chess
principle into real life. Unfortunately, these connections are shallow
at best, often completely missing the point. Rather than spend a few
paragraphs describing the emotional state of the game, the psychology of
position, the depth and beauty of the constant ebb-and-flow that makes
up every single game, he chose to say things like, "Successful people go
after what they want, and in that they resemble successful rooks.
Unsuccessful people don't go after what they want nor do they freely
interact with others. In that way, they resemble unsuccessful rooks."

Not only does this type of insight fail to capture anything worthwhile
that might arise from the chess principle of placing rooks on open
files, (No mention of clearing your paths before putting your strongest
forward efforts into something? How about the idea of looking for
openings and opportunities to strike fully? Or maybe you can think of it
less aggressively as an acknowledgement of your most peaceful path.) he
instead chooses to blurt out a ridiculous claim that has no basis in
anything. Unsuccessful people don't interact freely with others? What on
earth is that about? It's meaningless and downright wrong.

Perhaps if he had titled this book: The Superficial Life Metaphors of
Chess, I would have been more satisfied. Though I'd be hard pressed to
find even that level of usefulness in here.

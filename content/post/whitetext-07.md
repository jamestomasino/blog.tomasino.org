_whitetext was a private livejournal account I kept following a breakup in 2004.
The entries came from a deep depression. They have been recollected here for
data preservation._

i slept early the past two nights. i slept early and woke up early. it was
cleansing, cathartic. i hoped to do it more, but i stayed up late tonight
talking. it was worth it, of course. any time you can trade sleep for secrets it
is worth it. and the secrets i learned were good ones too. but i've always been
a very solemn secret keeper, so i wont go into it more, not even on here (my
secret & private journal).

> i can recall the way she smelled in the car as soon as i sat down. the aroma

> i bought the scent once to see if it would bring back memories. her smell was
> different. it was the natural smell of her body. her sister had a similar one,
> but never again have i smelled hers exactly.

despite secrets, pain continues. the more recent past is moving on quickly. the
terms she already bestows on her new interest disgusts me, but i turn my head.
she is gone for good. i wont speak with her again. that decision was the
hardest.

> in the wintertime we woke up early one day. school started at 7:20 normally,
> but that day we started 2 hours late. we took the opportunity. each of us woke

> unsatisfying in itself, it held the doorway to a park hidden in the trees. we
> knew about it, each of us, from different places. that was the first and only
> time we stopped there. we walked to a small stone bridge a quarter-mile inside
> the forest and sat on the edge overlooking a small waterfall. back then there
> were no railings on the bridge. we lay against the cold cement and bundled
> ourselves in our coats and against each other. her smell was strong, and so
> was the other's. i was in the middle, soaking them in like the cold dampness
> all around me. i wont recall again what was said, what jokes were passed, or
> what people we talked about. i don't recall ever opening my mouth. i remember
> the haze over the water, the early morning sounds of winter, and most of all,
> the smell of cold damp air mixed with the essence of those two who were
> closest to me in the world.

there are fond memories of all of them. they haunt me like uncountable ghosts,
settling on my arm and revealing my lamentations. i used to cry myself to sleep
every night, and vomit every morning. my sickness used to be skin deep.

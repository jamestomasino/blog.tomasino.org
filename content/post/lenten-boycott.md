Today in the United States many people are partaking in a boycott of major
businesses as a protest against the policies of the current administration and
the preemptive acquiescence of these mega-corporations. With that in mind, and
Ash Wednesday just around the corner, I'd like to give the religious folks out
there an idea. The Lenten boycott.

## Why

Participating in a boycott of this nature during Lent is a fitting activity
because it aligns with the focus of the season. Sacrifice, social justice, and
self-discipline. It's a traditional time for Christians to practice fasting,
prayer, and almsgiving, all focused on encouraging a deeper relationship with
God. Lets look at some of these aspects and how they align with a boycott.

### Solidarity with the oppressed

Jesus' suffering and call to care for the marginalized is at the heart of the
Lenten spirit. Responding to unethical practices as they apply to unfair labor,
environmental harm, and human rights abuses is a way to express personal
commitment to justice.

### Sacrifice

Boycotting companies and products that are a major cornerstone of the modern way
of life will mean giving up convenience and comfort. That mirrors the spirit of
self-denial and fasting, and does it in a way that the Gospel on Ash Wednesday
promotes: in your home, in secret.


### Almsgiving

Instead of the money spent on these boycotted companies, needs can be met from
local businesses. Where there is no need to replace, the difference in spending
can be sent to charities working against these same challenges that are being
felt by your community.

### Repentance

Boycotts of this nature are a personal fight against systemic injustice and that
can be a sign of personal repentance for past complicity. It's a step toward
spiritual growth.


## Does it matter?

But does it actually make a difference? Your quiet protest, a boycott in your
own home, isn't going to make a blip on the balance sheets for Walmart or
Amazon, right?

Except it does have an impact in many other ways. Lets first address your own
spiritual growth and personal integrity. This matters to your soul. That alone
makes it worth doing, and certainly more-so than giving up chocolate for a few
weeks. It's also an activity that will constantly reorient you toward societal
need. You're choosing day-in-day-out to align your spending with your values,
even if nobody else is doing it.

Your efforts will support small and local businesses. Redirecting money from
these large corporations to those in your community who may be feeling the need
more than ever matters so much. It strengthens our communities and bonds. It
also promotes ethical, sustainable commerce.

Those internal changes, the quiet action, might also be an inspiration to those
close to you. Small actions shared in quiet conversations might encourage
friends or family to reflect on their own habits. And that action, even
symbolic, makes a statement. One person's refusal to participate in unethical
action is an act of conscience that can have powerful spiritual shockwaves.

Finally, it's a way to build a muscle. Lent is temporary, but how many Lenten
sacrifices have become life-long habits for people later? These 40 days can form
a pattern for mindful spending that will last beyond the season and encourage
you to continue growing. Even if nobody joins you, your actions reflect your
values, and that effort will lead to more.

## How?

But how do you do it? Even if you wanted to, is it just not going on Amazon? Do
you need to cancel subscriptions?

Here's what I recommend:

1. Define your boundaries - What type of s pending do you want to avoid?
   Fast-food, chain stores, online retail? Are there exceptions you need?
2. Shop local - Groceries from farmers markets and co-ops. Local restaurants.
   Thrift stores. Local artists. Use local service merchants.
3. Use cash - Withdraw money each week to hold yourself to a budget. Needing to
   pay with your hands keeps your spending local.
4. Reduce - What can you give up completely? What can you make at home? What can
   you do that's free instead? Dust off those board games and invite your
   friends over.
5. Avoid delivery - If you do need something, go to the local shop. If you don't
   have the energy to go out, don't get it!
6. Think about your transportation - If you can reduce your reliance on gas,
   that would be amazing. Can you work remote? Can you take public transit?
   Carpool? Can you do these changes some of the time if you can't do it all the
   time?
7. Build community - What can you trade or lend with friends instead of
   purchasing. Chat with your friends about media collections. What movies and
   books do you have that you can "shop" from each other? What about swap meets?
   If you don't know what's going on in your area and what's available, call the
   library and ask a librarian. They know EVERYTHING.

This is an opportunity, not a command. If some of this appeals to you and your
spirituality then I hope you give it a try. If you aren't Christian or don't
participate in Lent, these actions may still be worth exploring. Give it some
thought. Ash Wednesday is just around the corner.

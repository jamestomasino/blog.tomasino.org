*'Behold, days are coming,' declares the LORD, 'when I will fulfill the good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and the house of Judah.'*

*- Jeremiah 33:14*

Advent, from the Latin verb advenire—'to come' or adventus—'an arrival'.
It is a season of waiting and preparation, but its real significance
seems to fade into the background for many of us when faced with the
imminent Christmas holiday. The sombre celebrations we have at mass, the
simple decorations and quiet anticipatory spirit don't mesh with the
manic energy of holiday shopping, fourth quarter work binges, and family
trips. We are entering a season that calls upon us for extra vigilance,
yet we find ourselves perhaps less aware of the happenings around us
than ever.

What is it we're celebrating, anyway? Why do we call out the time before
Christmas like this, or why do we call out the Lenten time before
Easter? Wouldn't it be easier on us to simply get together on Christmas
morning with our families and friends and give gifts? What's with all
the anticipation?

> *Moreover, I will give you a new heart*
> *and put a new spirit within you; and I will remove the heart of stone*
> *from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.*
>
> *- Ezekiel 36:26*

The promises of God to his people Israel go back to the earliest books
of the Bible. Through all the scriptures of the old testament we hear
the prophets speak again and again of the fulfillment of these promises.
As the poor, enslaved people fled into the desert and wandered for years
and years, they lived and thrived upon the promises of God. For
generations, through strife with enemies from abroad and disturbingly
misguided actions from within their own numbers, they continued to
preserver, waiting for the promised days to come. They chose their first
king and watched as his love for glory almost destroyed them, but God's
promises still held true. With the new king raises a great house, one
that would survive for 41 more generations (or 27 according to Matthew)
before the fulfillment of God's promise.

These weren't empty years for Israel. They weren't just opening acts to
the main event. These hundreds of years were filled by real lives, real
suffering and real joy. Their hope for the future was real, and their
vigilance was strong. From Ezekiel to Jeremiah to Luke, the sense of
anticipation is so powerful you can feel it in their words.

Advent is a symbol, but it is not just a red (or purple, if you will)
carpet leading to Christmas. It is a symbol of Israel and their long
history of faith, hope, and watchfulness.

Read carefully the lines of my favorite Christmas hymn and see if you
can find Advent's powerful sense union and anticipation.

>  *Oh, come, oh, come, Emmanuel,

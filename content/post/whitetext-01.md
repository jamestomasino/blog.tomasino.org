_whitetext was a private livejournal account I kept following a breakup in 2004.
The entries came from a deep depression. They have been recollected here for
data preservation._

why do i do this? what possesses me, or drives the need in me, to write
a journal out in public? i have plenty of paper journals where i could spill my
mind and bottle it up again on a shelf, but they don't feel freeing or helpful
anymore. this is different somehow. there is a subtle relief in the possibility
of someone pushing the random journal button and finding my self-commentary,
reading it, and finding a connection. perhaps it's a silly dream, like believing
that a song could change the world, or maybe it's just a crazy hope that there
are still people out there who believe i'm worth their time.

the thing is, i'm not looking for pity or attention. i don't really care much
for either of those. that's one of the reasons i'm starting this journal instead
of just writing it in my other one. i want anonymous companionship. i want
whatever the internet can give me akin to a cheap one night stand, or even
a silent mistress. just let the damned compassion die away and give me someone
who will wallow with me and tell me that they "empathize" instead of
"sympathize". it can't be that hard to find a person who would rather cry with
me than console me.

_whitetext was a private livejournal account I kept following a breakup in 2004.
The entries came from a deep depression. They have been recollected here for
data preservation._

when it comes time to sever the ties that bind us, i am more than willing on
most any occasion. this time it isn't mine to sever, at least, not directly. but
that isn't important. the important thing has nothing to do with other people,
but everything to do with myself.

i take off my glasses at night.there is nothing quite so accurate about me as
that. i've always seen better (not clearer) without them. i suppose people might
see me better that way as well. i wasn't meant to see things clearly, crisply.
i was meant to view the world through a haze of insubstantial forms, echoed by
colors my mind generates from unknown sources. i am meant to see the halo's of
light drifting around everything. if i lived long ago, or in a world without
science, that is what i would see. my days would be short and filled with
a focus on other things besides sight.

i feel so empty, so alone sometimes. i read journals of people i've taken off my
list and hope to see some mention of myself. i listen in on conversations and
hope to find relation. i don't know what i want. maybe just an escape.

i am torn between so many desires, i can't find my way to logic or rest. i will
sleep and wake, and perhaps be a bit more clear.

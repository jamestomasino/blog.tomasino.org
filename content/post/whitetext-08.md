_whitetext was a private livejournal account I kept following a breakup in 2004.
The entries came from a deep depression. They have been recollected here for
data preservation._

fridays have been relaxing days for me recently. they are my days when i lay
back and let everything go forward without me. i get little to nothing
accomplished and never fault myself for it. saturday and sunday can be given
over to hard work, but not my fridays. i will lay in bed, watch movies,
television, listen to music, download exciting things and chat with people
online. i love my fridays, even if they are too short.

we all need our breaks. we need them especially if we are pushing ourselves
beyond our normal limits. i've been pushing so hard for the past year i can
barely look down and recognize my own body. i've taken a record number of
credits in a semester, argued and pleaded with professors to let me take classes
that weren't even being offered. i have gone weeks without sleep. i've turned
a second-rate laptop lab into a high-powered rendering farm because of absolute
necessity. i've given debates, speeches, presentations, and reports in front of
officials and administration i've never met nor heard of before. i most
certainly need a break, but it wont happen. i'll get a breather in a few weeks.
it will be a stint between semesters, but nothing more. i gave myself over to
this promise of completing the impossible, and for what? for a promise of
a future that vanished while i was off to war.

i could write about all of this all day long. sometimes i think it would be
helpful to do it. the way my mind works, i must spend half the day thinking the
depressing thought that all of this is for nothing. i look in the eyes of people
i know here, i see promise, hope, compassion, and a genuine plan that someday
their lives will be better than they are today. they make decisions on that
assumption. they choose who to spend time with, who to ignore, what drama to
bitch about, and what lifestyle to live all based on that same optimism. i can't
spend too much time in that world. i constantly need an escape, back in my room,
away and alone. i need to revitalize my own sense of being by brushing them all
away. i wash my hands all the time, but my palms still sweat this blood.

there really isn't anything i'm working towards anymore. i wanted to teach, but
it is growing stale. i wanted to learn about fun exciting things, like video
games, but it is wearing on me too. i wanted a life of love and companionship.
it will come back to me, i'm sure, but today it is so far, it might as well be
a star.

![In-Step][]

When I was in [boot camp][] we weren't allowed to drink things while
walking. You could drink your water, sure. You could walk around (albeit
at right angles), but you couldn't do the two things together. I seem to
remember someone asking why to a muttered response about preventing
accidents. Whether it had a reason or not, it was one of the parts of
our culture there.

I bring it up because a few minutes ago I was filling up my water bottle
by the office sink. I screwed the cap back on top and went to take a
drink when it hit me: I was walking. There I was, deep in thought about
some project or another, when I experienced "Navius-Interruptus". I was
standing again in the mess during service week, wearing my utilities and
feeling less than clean. How strange.

We had a million of these little rules. How many more will creep up on
me over the years? It took half a decade to stop walking in step with
everyone around me. I imagine it will always feel weird to take a drink
while walking now. Old habits die hard, even the silly ones.

![The Written](https://photo.goodreads.com/books/1302564004m/10754266.jpg)

My rating: [1 of 5 stars][]

I don't feel like spending a long time tearing this book apart, so I'll
just say it briefly. The writing is just very poor.

"All of a sudden" and its like are overused. The drama is summarized and
told rather than shown. The characters are flat and seem to be the
author's favorite D&D personas, not real people. Descriptions are filled
with mad-lib-esque adjectives of a poor, and often repetitive, nature.
Nothing pops.

I'll be honest. I picked it up because of the cover art, and it just
wasn't worth it.

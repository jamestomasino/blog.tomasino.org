<span style="font-style: italic;">
For my omniscience paid I toll

In infinite remorse of soul.

All sin was of my sinning, all

Atoning mine, and mine the gall

Of all regret. Mine was the weight

Of every brooded wrong, the hate

That stood behind each envious thrust,

Mine every greed, mine every lust.

And all the while for every grief,

Each suffering, I craved relief

With individual desire, --

Craved all in vain! And felt fierce fire

About a thousand people crawl;

Perished with each, -- then mourned for all!

    - Edna St. Vincent Millay - Excerpt from [Renascence][]
(1917)</span>

Atonement is an act of reparation made for the goal of reconciliation.
I've had more than my share of things to ask forgiveness for.

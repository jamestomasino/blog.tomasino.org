<span style="font-style:italic;">When I lived in Indiana, one semester
at [IUPUI][] I had a four hour break between classes on Tuesdays. Back
then, the [Indianapolis Museum of Art][] was free, so I would spend my
afternoons there with a pencil and a [Moleskine][]. I would sit for a
few hours in front of one of the paintings and let my mind wander in it
for a while. Then I would take my notebook and write a quick story,
scene, narrative, or stream-of-consciousness from deep inside. This is
one of those journals.</span>

Childe Hassam - Cliff Rock - Appledore, 1903

There was no landing here. The river was wild and the rocks sharp. To
leave the safety of the captain's narrow path would mean death for all
of them. It wasn't the cliffs jutting up high into the air on either
side that they were watching with such fearful vigilance. No, the river
ran wide with plenty of room to maneuver. The real worry was the shallow
rocks lurking just below, invisible, like diamonds in a pool; they were
scattered pins dropped in a carpet, threatening to prick from the quiet,
murky depths.

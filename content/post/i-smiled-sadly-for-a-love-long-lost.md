<span style="font-style: italic;">From an old journal</span>

I smiled sadly for a love long lost

to tears and wishes and dried up wells

and inside felt a great wall crack

splitting side to farthest side

a dam flooded with torrent anew.

From wellspring to memory, I

lost inside the downpour

left dry, cracked and empty

now inside filling with brackish delight



Breaking away the docks washed by

hurled in a sea of storms and

tore from me those lingering dreams

and anchors to the past.

Set adrift the touching the breathing

and perfumed hair of long gone winds

pulled along amidst the waves

to endless sky and endless sea.

On this shore buried deeply

my feet and legs and torso drought

with fear or pain or numbness parched

for any small piece of rain to fall

of waves to splash or sweat to rise.

Waiting in vain for tears to fall

when all had washed love long away.

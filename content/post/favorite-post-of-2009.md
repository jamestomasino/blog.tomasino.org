Hey bloggers! It's that time of year again when we all get to look back
over the past year of our lives and take special note of the beauty and
the beast that has been our previous 365 days.

Fellow blogger, [Elizabeth Esther][] from "Kids, Twins, and Laundry
Bins" is hosting a special Saturday Evening Blog Post where people are
asked to submit their favorite blog entry from 2009. I chose [The Most
Beautiful Thing in the World][]. What will you pick? Pop on over
[here][] and make your choice.

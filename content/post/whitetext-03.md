_whitetext was a private livejournal account I kept following a breakup in 2004.
The entries came from a deep depression. They have been recollected here for
data preservation._

sitting in a cozy coffeehouse sipping down my favorite droughts and chatting
over philosophy seems like a dream to me now, but not long ago that was how
i lived my days. i can remember sitting with friends and playing go or chess and
discussing philosophy, history, and fantasy. anything is fair game over a cup of
java, especially when your greatest true worry is about the person you're with.
maybe it was a time of innocence for me, but that is irrelevant. it was my
golden time, and that which i will fight to get back to.

a coffeehouse, like a bookstore, has certain types of people, and while varied
in themselves, you can expect the same varying groups at almost any place you go
to. the same is true of many things, i suppose. i can always find my past when
i visit a diner in the middle of the night. and i can always see myself when
i glance between the shelves of the metaphysical section, even if it is bare.
just the other day i walked through the shelves at a local bookstore and noticed
the smell immediately. although the rest of the store had the smell of new
bindings and clean shelves, that small metaphysical section spelled heavily of
patchouli. it brought a smile to me.

there is not time like the past, for it will always be there ever unchanging.
it, unlike the future or present, will grow more wondrous and happy with time
as the bad memories fade and leave only the happy thoughts. no, it is most
certain that you can never go back there, and would never want to either,
because to go back to the past would make it so much less. the past is flawless.

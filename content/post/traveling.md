<span style="font-style: italic;">I find the great thing in this world
is not so much where we stand, as in what direction we are moving: To
reach the port of heaven, we must sail sometimes with the wind and
sometimes against it,--but we must sail, and not drift, nor lie at
anchor.</span>

    - Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. - [The Autocrat of the
Breakfast-Table][] (1858)

Long before hyper-modern forms of travel enabled us to escape to a new
life or a new world in the blink of an eye, the overwhelming desire to
leave, to travel, to explore, boiled the blood of many men. Passion du
voyage, reislust, mehetnék, λαχτάρα για ταξίδια, страсть к путешествиям,
wanderlust; the words carry the same feeling in every language, but I
believe it is the German word 'fernweh' that speaks most linguistically
true. As heimweh is the word for 'homesick', so fernweh, then, is that
same longing feeling for another, unknown place. It is a farsickness.

Perhaps the why's of wanderlust aren't as important as they once were to
me. I've come to know the feeling as a part of me. At times it is quiet,
waiting, letting me enjoy a place or people. At times it grows restless
and I know it's time to go. Even in those quiet times, though, I am
aware of it like I am aware of the gasoline in my car. I know one day
the tank will run dry and I must be ready. That readiness is something
that's grown over time.

As a child, the choice to stay or go was never mine. I remember times
when my parents' jobs would force us to pick up and head to a new city,
and it was frightening. I didn't want to leave my friends, my home, my
school. I don't know if the lust wasn't in me yet, if I hadn't come to
understand it, or if I was blissfully ignorant because of my lack of
control. Whatever the reason, those times ended with high school.

In college I took drives, many drives. The need to get away grew
stronger all the time and I didn't know what else to do. I packed up the
car with snacks, if I had that much forethought, and started driving.
The roads took me where they willed.

Once, I remember crossing the endlessly flat, barren terrain of
Nebraska. A rail-road ran along side of my car. Slowly I passed by a
train, only to stop and fill up my tank and watch the train pass me by
again. I think that is when I understood.

Over the years, I've grown better at moving on. I've learned how to pick
up any stray roots I've lain, organize my life and possessions, plot a
course and set sail. It's never been a sad thing, for me at least, to
leave a place. I know I take so much from each stop on my journey, from
each person I've met and story I've heard. The experiences fill me with
joy and strengthen my faith, not only in God, but in human beings. It's
allowed me the distinct opportunity to share in the lives of hundreds of
fine people, some of whom I will not see again. Regardless, they are a
part of me now.

At times I look back on those people and compare myself, judging whether
I've made any real progress or not. Like Mr. Holmes says, "...we cannot
help instituting comparisons between our present and former selves by
the aid of those who were what we were, but are not what we are." It is
not a point of pride, or a means of looking down on the others. The true
comparison is against our former selves. When the wind changes, am I a
better person than I was?

Wanderlust is not the why. It is not the how or even the what. It is a
spark inside that calls for change, but it is the change itself that is
the message. What do we want from our new place and people? Who does it
serve? What can we do to make it better, make ourselves better? In all
my traveling, that is the most important lesson I've learned. I know of
no better way to prepare for the journey.

_whitetext was a private livejournal account I kept following a breakup in 2004.
The entries came from a deep depression. They have been recollected here for
data preservation._

i think there are too many things in my days. they keep me from being truly
happy. in my mind, i want to spend an afternoon watching a flower, or an evening
with my feet in the cool waters of a stream. i want to sit still on my floor,
letting the moonlight drape across my body. i don't think of these things as
lazy. i don't think of them as inaction. they would be the greatest, most pure
action i could ever do. the perfect experience.

there is too much in my life. too much furnature, too many books, too much sound
and light and coffee. too much oxygen. far, far too many people.

william penn once said, "true silence is the rest of the mind, and is to the
spirit what sleep is to the body, nourishment and refreshment." i've been
without true silence for so long, i'm beginning to forget the sound. even in my
meditations it is getting harder and harder to quiet myself. i've never been in
that position before, and it frightens me. it makes me want to take action, any
action, to try and solve my situation. the future is vague.

<span style="font-style:italic;">He had already understood that he would
never leave that room, for it was foreseen that the city of mirrors
would be wiped out by the wind and exiled from the memory of men at the
precise moment when Aureliano Babilonia would finish deciphering the
parchments, and that everything written on them was unrepeatable since
time immemorial and forever more, because races condemned to one hundred
years of solitude did not have a second opportunity on earth.</span>

    - Gabriel Garcia Marquez - [One Hundred Years of Solitude][] (1967)

There is an insatiable restlessness that slowly creeps up my spine as a
change nears. Like the flight or fight response that evolutionists tout
as the basic behavior of fear, my nerves tense in anticipation of
something soon to come. They are ready, even if the rest of me isn't,
for that unknowable future that will befall at any moment. Yet I have to
wonder about this unease and its usefulness. Is it helpful to me? Does
it provide some security to be on guard, excited, or otherwise
energized?

The important things are done. My life is tidy, the various threads in
order. There is nothing to provoke this nervousness, but still it comes.
It forces my mind to parallels and analogies, of times, in particular,
that I wasn't so prepared for the same.

Things take the shape of a great cloud of doom that approaches from the
West, and I, fatigued, broken, struggle to run away on legs too short
and insufficient. Foliage tears at my feet, grasping my ankles, pulling
me to the ground again and again; all the while I know that the running
is hopeless. Even if there were a destination, that cloud will overtake
me long before I make my way anywhere important.

And it is at times like these of fearful clarity that I recognize what
it is that terrifies me so much as to drive all logic and planning away
and leave me shaking, unable to concentrate or breathe deeply. I fear
that small spark of mortality to which I cling with endless pride and
selfishness. It is a fear not of letting go, but of being unable to do
so. What if I cannot surrender myself to this? What if the temptations
of flesh or food, of rest and rain, of any and everything, of this world
cannot be broken? There I see condemnation, failure.

So I run, careful to cut the ties with my planning and organization,
careful to avoid the connections that might bind me immutably to this
place or these people. After-all, wasn't it St. Augustine who said,
"Complete abstinence is easier than perfect moderation." Let me be away
from all things and let my time here be short, for I am not strong
enough to keep there long.

Of course, the panic settles after a few deep breaths and I remember
that I'm not alone. There's no fear in being too weak to go through this
alone. God is with me, hand-in-hand. I can grasp for His strength and it
is always there ready to lift me up and past these fears. It is a battle
won in His service, not with guns and swords, but with an open and
steady heart that gives itself over rather than being its own keeper.

The fear remains, but I don't shake now. My hands are held steady and I
am ready again to take a step forward, and another, until my time does
come. Sometimes the simplest decisions are the most important, and the
most difficult. The decision to wake up each day and say to Him, "Yes, I
still believe," is sometimes all I can bear to give, and it has to be
enough.

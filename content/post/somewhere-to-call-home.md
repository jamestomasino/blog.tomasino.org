![Kitchen in Mosfellsbær](https://blog.tomasino.org/images/mosfellsbaer-kitchen.jpg)

We have an apartment!

After a whirlwind weekend of apartment hunting we somehow managed to get
extremely lucky. We traveled to pretty much every corner of Reykjavík and
its neighboring municipalities and saw so many places my head is a blur.
By far the most impressive unit was in Mosfellsbær, one of the furthest
areas from downtown and one of our top picks. It's the garden town of the
capital area and it didn't disappoint. But first, let me tell you about
the apartment.

It's a whopping 135 square meters, or over 1430 square feet, which is just
enormous for a place in this city. It's got three bedrooms, a living room,
kitchen with island, big bathroom, big washroom, and an extra
hallway-nook-office thing. There's plenty of storage in the basement and
a private garage (not that we have a car). We're on the first floor and
have a little patio garden, and the building is literally across the
street from Wit's school. How amazing is that?

The entire area is overrun by new construction. We couldn't count the
number of apartment buildings going up, and from what we hear that's been
the case for the last few years.

After seeing the apartment we walked down the hill to
[Álafoss](https://alafoss.is/), the birthplace of the Icelandic wool
industry. It's a beautiful little corner spot with a knife maker and wool
shop. It's basically heaven for Leah. Continuing down the trails brought
us through a garden setting and nature walk, past playgrounds, and
eventually a sports complex and pool. We trudged up a hill and found
ourselves in the heart of Mosfellbær. It's definitely walkable, but when
we're lazy or the weather is bad the bus service in the area is still
really good.

Mosfellsbær is surrounded by mountains and hills ripe for hiking. There's
trails everywhere, horse riding nearby, and it's a hop, skip, and a jump
from the sea. It should provide a great backdrop for the next few years.

I'll have my rental agreement in hand in the next day or two and we'll be
able to move our things in sometime next week. It's just in time since the
container is getting on the boat this weekend.

Next up, Leah's immigration paperwork, Wit's school, and…

Who knows‽

My rating: [3 of 5 stars][]

I picked this up for free from the Amazon Lending Library. I recently
read Night Circus and thought I might enjoy one more circus related book
before I head back into genre fiction once again.

The writing was solid, the characters each believable and likable, and
the story interesting. The book's strength came from a wonderfully
researched circus train and a dismally realistic portrayal of the
despair of old age. Each world grounded the other in reality and made
this story something special.

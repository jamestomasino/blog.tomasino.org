Tonight is my last night in this house. We move into the apartment
tomorrow and close on the sale on Monday. These seven years have
been the longest I've ever lived in one place. It's always
a little sad closing one chapter, but the joy and excitement of
starting the next is a natural counterbalance.

I took a picture of my son lying in bed dreaming his last dreams
here. He's only ever known this home and all its space. The
apartment will be a big change for him. He's got the magical
flexibility of youth on his side. I just hope he stays as kind and
joyful as he is now.

For the next seven months we'll be preparing for the move out of
the country. All the major hurdles have been overcome and now it's
just a matter of doing the work. This summer, God willing, we'll
be living in Iceland.

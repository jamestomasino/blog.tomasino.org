The last real conversation I had with Erin before all of this started
was about <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Alice in
Wonderland</span>. Specifically, it was about Mabel. I'm not sure how
many of you have read <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Alice in
Wonderland</span>, but Mabel is a friend of Alice's from school whom she
mentions early on. Here is the passage:

> \`I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, \`for her hair goes in such long
> ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't
> be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such
> a very little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I, and–oh dear, how
> puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know.
> Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,
> and four times seven is–oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that
> rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try
> Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of
> Rome, and Rome–no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been
> changed for Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little– "' and she
> crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began
> to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words
> did not come the same as they used to do:–
>
> \`How doth the little crocodile
>
>  Improve his shining tail,
>
>  And pour the waters of the Nile
>
>  On every golden scale!
>
>
>
>  \`How cheerfully he seems to grin,
>
>  How neatly spread his claws,
>
>  And welcome little fishes in
>
>  With gently smiling jaws!'
>
> \`I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and her
> eyes filled with tears again as she went on, \`I must be Mabel after
> all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and
> have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to
> learn! No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down
> here! It'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying "Come
> up again, dear!" I shall only look up and say "Who am I then? Tell me
> that first, and then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if
> not, I'll stay down here till I'm somebody else"–but, oh dear!' cried
> Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, \`I do wish they WOULD put their
> heads down! I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'

In this section, Alice is beginning to doubt who she is. She wonders if
she is, in fact, someone other than herself specifically... not just a
different person in general. In the end, she decides that she must be
Mabel, a less intelligent friend of hers. Now, there are other sections
I could quote you, about how Alice farther suggests that she might be
more than one person... such as a part where she remembers trying to box
her own ears for cheating against herself in a game of croquet, but this
first quote is the most important. In particular, pay attention to the
line: ""I've made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down"
here!". It has always been my thought that in the two person dichotomy
of Alice, there is a split between the real world personality of Alice,
and the wonderland personality of Mabel. Mabel is, in fact, the
personality that stays, and not only interacts, but eventually controls
wonderland. She is beyond control of even the Queen, and later, when she
goes through the looking glass, not even the jabberwocky can pose a
threat to her. Mabel is the power in Alice, a power which exists and
resides permenantly within the fantasy. It is her real strength, despite
its containment within her psyche. It is an inner strength, a true inner
strength personified, and while it is less intelligent than herself, it
has a common sense that overwhelms the logical, the mundane, and see's
past the predictability of a simple nursery rhyme. Mabel saw beyond all
of it to a super-normal place where the innermost childish logic rang
true, her desires became powerful potions... spells even, and the magic
of her dreams was completely reality. Mabel's power was in her
imagination, but for her it was more than that. It was truth... mystical
truth.

One day, I'd love to put all of this into a story... a book perhaps, or
just a short fiction. I dunno... it's one of those few original ideas I
have that no one else seems to have noticed yet. Weird I guess. I never
gave it a whole lot of thought before, beyond the basics. I guess the
timing of it with Erin made it pop out at me. So... yeah. It's halfway a
commentary on how I feel these days, but I thought it might be a good
story for this journal too.

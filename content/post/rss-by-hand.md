I've been blogging for a long time, it seems. I have some old
[LiveJournal][] entries that go back well into the 90's. Mix that up
with some [Blogger][] posts here, some [MySpace][] posts there, and a
slew of others and you quickly run into the messy trail of journaling
I've left all over the net. So, what's one more blog on the fire, right?

Well, this time, I'm trying something new. Since I haven't found any
public blogs out there that I really enjoy, I've decided to make my own.
And how am I going to do that? Simple! I'm doing it by hand. I'm going
to write all the code for the RSS feed right here in
[<oxygen></oxygen>][].

I figured, most people don't read blogs on the actual blog site,
especially not mine. So there's no reason for me to make a whole GUI for
it. Instead, I'll write the RSS feed. Eventually, if I get around to it,
I'll write the code to "perma-link" these posts, and maybe even enable
comments. For now, enjoy the texty goodness.

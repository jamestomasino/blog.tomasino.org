I recently had a nice discussion with [my hackerspace](https://hakkavelin.is)
about Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGO) and Iceland's role in the
scheme. For those of you unfamiliar, REGOs are certificates that prove that
a certain amount of electricity has been generated from renewable sources. They
are issued by regulatory bodies and can be traded between energy suppliers and
consumers to demonstrate compliance with renewable energy targets.

The goal of REGOs is to provide transparency and accountability in the renewable
energy market, ensuring that consumers can make informed choices about the
source of their electricity.

You could consider them a next-generation implementation of carbon credits.
Previously the voluntary carbon market (VCM) proved to be incredibly unreliable
and unregulated. John Oliver had a [vicious
takedown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p8zAbFKpW0) of carbon credits a while
back. It's a great watch.

REGOs are an improvement on that scheme, relying on a regulated body, and with
source-origin proofs. You can be sure that the energy really was generated from
a valid source, not just a forest [someone promised not to intentionally burn
down](https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/climate-news/131979365/why-the-heat-is-on-carbon-offsets-claiming-to-protect-forest).

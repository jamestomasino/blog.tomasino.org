_whitetext was a private livejournal account I kept following a breakup in 2004.
The entries came from a deep depression. They have been recollected here for
data preservation._

i've found so many ways to herd myself forward over the past two years.
everytime i turn around i see another way to motivate myself even if it is only
for a day. my gypsy blood has pulled me all the way to alaska; a farther spot is
hard to find.

at the edge of civilization i toil by day in the drudgery of multimedia. it is
my burden, though it can hardly be called that. the work is enjoyable, the time
not a waste. and yet i know that i would never spend my time there were i given
an option. i would be standing in the woods with friends deep at night. we would
tell ghost stories and scare ourselves with the horrors we paint. we would press
close together in the cool air, smell each other, touch each other, and be at
peace.

this place will be a respite. i will force it that way. i have given myself over
to goals and lists as usual. i want to do everything, but i will be happy if
i do any of them. one day i will leave this place. i know this even though
i have just arrived. i know this and i accept it. i am a gypsy.

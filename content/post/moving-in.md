Today we got our keys!

{{< youtube uC2dWUujBEA >}}

Wit, Leah and I hopped on a bus this afternoon and traveled out to
Mosfellsb√¶r. We stopped in town and hit up the grocery store to grab a few
essentials (toilet paper, soap, a little towel) so that we could function.
We're not moving in properly until Monday, but we got the keys from the
landlord and took a tour of the place all put together.

There are a few remaining items to get sorted, as the whole building is
brand new. We don't have our light fixtures installed in the ceilings yet,
and there's still some masonry work being done outside. Everything inside
works, though.

Our container from the United States has also arrived in Iceland. It's
currently working its way through customs, and we hope to get it delivered
to the apartment very soon. Unfortunately, we don't have anyone lined up
to help us move things in from the container when it gets here. Maybe Leah
will have some time to look into that.

Tomorrow she's heading to IKEA to secure Wit a new loft bed and a couple
foam mattresses for us while we wait for the container to arrive. We may
be living in a very empty place for a few days next week. Yikes!

We're also going to be shopping for a washer and dryer to install in the
apartment. Most apartments don't come with appliances at all. This one
was great in that it had a refrigerator and stove and dishwasher already
installed. The only things remaining are the washer and dryer. The
building plumber is also on-hand to help with installations.

You can all look forward to some new pictures once things get settled in
place. Bless bless!

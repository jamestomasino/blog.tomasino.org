![American Gods](https://photo.goodreads.com/books/1258417001m/4407.jpg)

My rating: [1 of 5 stars][]

It's sad to say, but this book just bored me. I usually like Neil
Gaiman's stories, so don't read this as an attack on his talent or
anything, but sometimes individual works just don't connect.

In this case, American Gods felt aimless, detached, and more than a
little pointless. Not only did the big concepts fail to land, but the
little stuff as well. It's one thing when you have a book like
Neverwhere where a few of the characters are insanely quirky because
it's balanced out by the "straight man". Unfortunately, Shadow is a
terrible straight man. He doesn't question, he doesn't speak for the
reader, he just follows along moving from story segment to story segment
(note I don't call them plot points as most everything in here is
useless to the overall plot.)

Nope, it just didn't work for me.

_whitetext was a private livejournal account I kept following a breakup in 2004.
The entries came from a deep depression. They have been recollected here for
data preservation._

why do we do the things we do? a few hours ago, a friend left a message on my IM
telling me that she had run into a very old friend of mine whom i haven't talked
to in over three years. she left me the other girl's e-mail address too. i must
have sat there staring at it for a solid five minutes before i could do
anything.

after a long debate with myself, i copied the address into my contacts folder in
outlook... just in case. i stared at it there for another minute, though. it had
been so long, i wasn't sure i wanted it at this point. i had been quite happy
out of contact, but these days are different. single again, and lacking in close
friends, my desire for someone worthwhile in contact is strong. a weakness,
perhaps.

i had wasted so much on that family, on her and her sister both. time, energy,
love, all of it. i weighed and measured, and found it wasn't worth it to
continue. some loves aren't meant to be, no matter how intense. i wanted to get
away from them both, to push them into oblivion and never speak again. then,
magically, randomly, her address is in my hands.

i sent the e-mail a short while ago. it wasn't flattering, nor powerful or even
eloquent. it was a struggle to write and a struggle to click send. she will
find no pleasure in reading it, but perhaps find a hint of my regrets, of my
pain. i could have approached her differently. i could have worked my way back
into her life. it was masochistic enough to send the mail as it was, let alone
to have burrowed my way in the filth of that pain. perhaps that masochism will
prove cathartic. or perhaps it will prove deadly.

<span style="font-style: italic;">The tragedy of sexual intercourse is
the perpetual virginity of the soul.</span>

    - William B. Yeats

When I was a child, I dreamed of life as a game being played all around
me. Someone–the scorekeeper–was keeping close tabs on me, or perhaps on
all of us. When I kept quiet and in my own head, I could break ahead of
the curve and be prepared for the new things life would bring. I felt
like I was ever so slightly smarter than life expected me to be, and so,
with proper planning and a great deal of self-control I could surprise
life.

When I was a boy, I had a dream that one day sex would awaken me from
this game. I would be there, in the moment, and suddenly I would be
turned around, as if for all my life I was a separate person held to a
mask. In that mask was my life and I was pressed to it so closely that I
couldn't pull back. Or perhaps the process of being born into this life
lost that memory, and so I am stuck here because of my ignorance. Would
death release the mask? Would sex?

thy note,

to drown me in thy sister's flood of tears.</span>

    - William Shakespeare - The Comedy of Errors (1592 - 1594)

My life over the past ten years had been particularly prurient. Life and
relationships have been guided by my salacious desires much more than
anything else. It's been the cause of much of my pain and suffering, and
yet I still fall prey to its beckoning.

And so I try once again to elude the lubricious siren's call. Each day
is a new test, and unlike Odysseus, I have no mast on which to bind
myself back.

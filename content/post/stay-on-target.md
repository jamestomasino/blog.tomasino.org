After I was accepted into the novitiate, the Vocation Director offered a
warning that the time before entrance day could be very difficult. He
was right on the nose with that one. Despite my best efforts to stay on
task, my prayer life has been slipping. I need to refocus what I'm doing
and get back on track.

There are a number of books I should be reading right now that could
help me prepare, but instead I've been bingeing the [Dresden][] series.
It's really started getting good and I'm just tearing through them so
fast that it's really satisfying, but I think it has contributed to my
present situation. Normally I institute a very strict policy for myself
that I can read only one fantasy novel between my non-fiction books.
This keeps me from going off the deep end and losing myself into rich
series, like I did with the [Wheel of Time][] back at Rowan. I've let
myself become lax, and that will have to change.

As soon as I finish reading the 9th book in the series, I'll be jumping
back into [The First Jesuits][], which is incredibly interesting, but
reads like an encyclopedia. Still, it is one of the books I'm supposed
to be reading in preparation for entrance day, and I've let it slide now
for too long.

What about you folks out there? Is there something going on that you've
lost sight of, something you need to refocus, to stay on target?

_whitetext was a private livejournal account I kept following a breakup in 2004.
The entries came from a deep depression. They have been recollected here for
data preservation._

years ago in the late summertime, while the trees were signaling their fiery
warnings of approaching winter and the lingering calm away from school had
dulled to a dreary relaxation, my friend and i took it upon ourselves to build
an ornamental pond in his backyard. given the philosophical choice, though
unbeknownst to us at the time, we quickly abandoned thoughts of
a constructionist nature wherein we would begin by building the structures
surrounding the pond, and instead found great delight for no less than a week in
digging a gaping hole into the landscape behind his house perhaps fifty yards
away. in our ignorant way of confusing construction and destruction, we set to
work with vigor, tearing up roots and rocks, dirt and soul. perhaps we were
lucky that it didn't rain and make our jobs more difficult.

a week and change later, we stared into our hole dug with only as much
enthusiasm as we could muster in the short sessions devoted before trekking into
the woods on trips of discovery. for a moment as we stared we thought the
dangerous thoughts of those who have learned the doomed lesson of giving up. we
contemplated how easily we could stretch our legs and busy ourselves with
something more charming, such as pushing down dead trees or throwing rocks.

we eventually completed the pond, which included a pump and bacterial filter
system run through a six tier waterfall that fed into the thousand gallon
reservoir littered with koi and goldfish. We learned to line the pond, affixed
a charming rock garden around it, complete with japanese hanging lanterns and
a stone bench. by the winter, the pond was a beautiful addition to the house.

i can still recall our surprise in winter as the pond first froze over. we
punctured small holes in the ice, worried about the fate of the fish. days
later, our small holes had blossomed into ice funnels standing as high as six
inches off the surface. that was sign enough for us that everything would be
fine again by spring.

the fish survived. the pond still stands, but it has lost some magic over the
years. i can still see it if i visit, but that sense of creation, of
destruction, of love... has faded, like a shadow, like a forgotten bruise.

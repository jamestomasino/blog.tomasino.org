Today is the Icelandic holiday *B√≥ndadagur*, or "Husband's Day". It marks the
first day of the month of *√ûorri* in the old Icelandic calendar. Etymologically
speaking the holiday comes from the word *Bondi* which could mean man of the
house or even farmer, so the translation takes a few different forms.

Since this is a holiday geared toward the special "men of the house", there are
a number of interesting traditions that have grown up around it. Some of these
traditions are somewhat confusing; a man is supposed to climb into his pants
with only one leg, letting the other drag behind him, then hop throughout his
house in a sign of‚Ä¶ well, I'm not sure what that's supposed to signify. These
days we see celebrations a bit more in keeping with our culture. It's a day for
special treatment and pampering of the men in our lives.

Leah and Wit bought me a bar of chocolate and a bouquet of flowers to celebrate
the day. Leah also asked me what special meal I'd like prepared for my
faux-*√ûorrabl√≥t*.

What is *√ûorrabl√≥t*, you ask? Why that's a traditional midwinter feast held at
the start of √ûorri to usher in the coldest month of the year. √ûorri is
absolutely jam-packed with feasts and celebrations, to be honest. It's not
surprising, though, if you imagine the small farm community packed into their
turf home huddled down trying to survive the harshest season. Best to mix it up
with celebrations, drinking, feasting, and anything else to distract you.

The √ûorrabl√≥t feast is full of traditional delicacies, or horrors, depending on
your disposition. They are all foods of survival in this unforgiving landscape,
and still welcomed with joy in many households. Some of the dishes you could
expect to see are meats (pickled or salted, smoked, or dried) such as
*Hangikj√∂t* or "hanged meat", *sv√≠√∞* or seared lamb's skull, *hr√∫tspungar* or
ram testicles, *sl√°tur* or blood sausage, *har√∞fiskur* or dried fish, and treats
like Icelandic rye bread. *(Side note: I made sl√°tur with a friend's family
before Christmas and it's quite good. It's like haggis.)*

Now before you get excited about the awesome foods above, we didn't do much of
that ourselves this year. While I wouldn't say no to any of it myself, Leah and
Wit are not quite as welcoming. Instead I suggested we have meatloaf for dinner!
Leah makes an excellent recipe and it felt "meaty" enough to fit the holiday in
spirit. Besides, I'm the man of the house so it's my decision, right? üôÇ

Sadly we also learned this morning of the passing of the musician, Meatloaf.

Rest in peace, big guy. His name is Robert Paulson.

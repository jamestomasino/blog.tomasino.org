_whitetext was a private livejournal account I kept following a breakup in 2004.
The entries came from a deep depression. They have been recollected here for
data preservation._

last night i needed something creative to come out of me. i've been on the
computer too much, doing too much, awake, just too much. i went to walmart and
bought cheap watercolors, a palette and brushes and some very cheap paper. this
is the result of the first one. i'm not very good with watercolors, but they are
so wonderful to play with. i love the feeling they give in my hands and i love
how they force themselves to come out.

i think there will be more of these. maybe with digital emphasis, maybe without.
it's all in the air right now.

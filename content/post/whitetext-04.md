_whitetext was a private livejournal account I kept following a breakup in 2004.
The entries came from a deep depression. They have been recollected here for
data preservation._

i wonder if alcoholism is really a bad thing. i wonder because i fear there
isn't anything worth being sober for. my fears and anxieties materialize in
mixed company, amidst a bar and karaoke with aquaintances. i sang a duet tonight
only to be reminded of those i wish i'd left behind in highschool. i scream to
myself to let loose from this immaturity and to cling to some hope of redemption
through intellecutalism. instead, i am tempted to waste more time and spend more
energy with those whom i left in the past long ago. i didn't know them then, nor
were they at my level, but none-the-less, they wait in my past for me now.

i am torn between responsibility, possibility, and desire. two whom i fear might
get together draw closer every day. i fear the relationship as i might fear
a root canal, and yet i say little. they desire each other on some unknowing
level, drawn towards disaster and pain. i know the truth, see it coming, and yet
i am in no position to help them. do i know either well enough to stand up for
it anyway? probably not. the pain will certainly help at least one. the other is
too artistic and independant to suffer much. illogically, i worry.

i am sick of the past, yet it haunts me with possibilities. i may call her
again, but i wont say what i might say. let time take its path.

The last two days have been an exhaustive drain on my nerves. If it's
not one thing, it's another. That's what Dave said at least, and I think
he's right. Whether it has been a work thing or a personal one or even
catching a traffic light, the last two days have been horrible.

Tonight I set myself a few specific tasks to accomplish. I thought I'd
be done with everything by the early afternoon and I could go do
something fun, or maybe just work out. Instead, I'm still sitting in my
office at 10:15, writing a blog post as another print job inevitably
fails. I am frustrated.

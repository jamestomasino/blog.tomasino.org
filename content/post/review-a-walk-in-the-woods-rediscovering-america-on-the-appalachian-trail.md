My rating: [2 of 5 stars][]

This book started out very strong for me. I loved the author's voice and
his subject matter. I read the first half of the book in one sitting,
but then upon taking it up again, I faltered. I didn't feel a strong
appeal in going back, and I really didn't feel like it was important to
finish. There is a bit of a parallel there between my reading and
Bryson's hiking, I suppose. It was a good trip down memory lane,
recalling my own adventures on the trail. It was interesting to read
about some of the history as well. In the end, though, the story just
didn't have that spark that kept me asking, "what happens next?"

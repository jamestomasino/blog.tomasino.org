_whitetext was a private livejournal account I kept following a breakup in 2004.
The entries came from a deep depression. They have been recollected here for
data preservation._

today was my birthday. twenty-six years old. i'm reminded of those years during
my teens when i was either away at summer camp, on a trip somewhere, or later,
in boot camp; those were the years i somehow missed my birthday. it passed by
and there was no change. for me birthdays are a time to take stock of the world
around me, to remind myself of the passage of time and my growth through it.
i sit on my floor, look out at the midnight bright sky, and i remember those
places i have been on my previous birthdays.

the days are long here. birthdays are even longer.

<span style="font-style: italic;">Salt and sea,
Of ill stay free,
Fire and air
Draw all that is fair
Around and around
The circle is bound</span>
    - Starhawk (Miriam Simos) - [The Spiral Dance][]

In this apartment my bed is lofted about 5.5 feet. It provides a very
snug spot for me to slide in at night, especially with the ceiling fan
being so close. In a way it reminds me of my Navy times, some had, some
that I would have had. The little sleeve of space is just like a ship
berth.

I've always liked little spaces. When I was a little kid, my dad built
me little fort areas under the basement stairs. In my first two houses
they offered me a small bit of isolation in which to feel totally secure
and alone. I dreamed stories and lives in those forts. To me, it makes
sense when I draw associations between those old forts and this bed I'm
on my way to. The dreams are even the same.

When the correlation game begins to play in my mind, it's difficult to
stop it. After I remember the fort under the stairs, or the solitude and
strength found in a tent in the wilderness, or the cells in the
monastery in southern Indiana, I begin to see that same sacred space in
my own mind. It is there, hidden behind the bright smile or the laughing
eyes, or perhaps the tired brow and snapping teeth. Inside that space is
a secluded refuge where the gusty winds of life are filtered down to a
soft scent on a breeze and the confusions of society are reduced to
spiraling self-absorbed thoughts of the divine.

It is as peaceful as any closet and as protected. From inside, I let
open the screen door to allow in the Chopin in my headset, careful to
leave out the strange noises of the cat near my door. I draw a deep
breath and let my mind wander on the thought that in so many places in
this very moment, there are so many others in their sacred space as
well.

It was one of the first topics of discussion in Eliade's <span
style="text-decoration:underline">The Sacred and the Profane</span>,
when his treatise on comparative religion espoused the great
similarities in the treatment of a sacred space. There were so many
powerful shared properties, from the <span
style="font-style:italic">axis mundi</span> to the discussion on
microcosmic connotations for the super-space of our existence. And it
makes logical sense why it would be so important to so many cultures
throughout the ages.

Our understanding of space lies outside our sociological learned
behaviors. It is a core emotion granted to us from the beginning. No
matter how outgoing, inquisitive or friendly, we each value our moments
of isolation. Even if those moments are only a breath in length, they
give us strength and resolve. They give us rest.

When I was little I built forts. I played under the stairs, or connected
cardboard boxes. I hung sheets from bunk beds and stacked cushions in
corners. Sometimes I would invite friends in, just sometimes. These days
my cat shares my newest fort with me. He's climbing up there now,
letting me know in his not-so-subtle way that I'm taking too long at the
keyboard.

In any matter, I recognize that I'm a person who values and loves his
alone time. It is the source of the true me and the place to which he
returns every night. It is beautiful and powerful. And you're all
invited.

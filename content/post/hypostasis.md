I love this reading. It's the most direct explanation of faith in the
New Testament, and though it's not meant to be a precise definition, per
se, it teaches us something remarkably important about it. Faith is more
than an on/off switch. It is more than whether you think God is real or
not. Faith is not a synonym of belief.

Faith is a gift and it's a response. It is a mystical part of us that
forms up around our hope and orients on the awesome. It is our
ground-work, the foundation upon which we walk. It is the strength upon
which we build up our belief, because it allows us to look at the <span
style="font-style:italic">numinous</span>, the ineffable, and give us
the strength of will to answer yes. It is God's hand reaching down to us
and saying, "It's okay to believe."

I think that's what I love most about faith. It doesn't come from us.
It, like all of our great gifts, comes from God. We are asked to take
it, be thankful for it, and offer it back to him. When we don't have
faith, what we're really doing is turning away that gift, and that, in a
nutshell, is true free will. God offers us something and we can choose
to accept it or not. The rest of what we call freedom is an illusion,
but I'll write more on that another day.

*The key term that causes such a differentiation in the translation of
this verse is the Greek word "hypostasis". A much more in-depth analysis
of the various translations is available [here][].*

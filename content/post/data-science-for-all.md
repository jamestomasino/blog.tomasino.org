There is so much data in the world
that's now available to all of us.
Just considering what is
shared by the United States government
in its open data initiative
there is an inconceivable plethora of information
waiting to be
explored,
processed,
and researched.
The challenge facing modern data science
is less about access
and more about human resources
and the ingenuity
to ask great questions.

I've played with
R and Julia programming languages
in the past
to broaden my own capabilities
in data science.
Our tool sets are powerful now,
even for casual programmers
and researchers.
I can dig around
and find data sets to dig through
when given a problem,
but I suffer from a horrible
writers-block-like sense
when facing the blank page.
When practicing my programming skills,
which project should I take on?
Do I do something
that can help the world?
Do I dig through crime statistics
or weather figures
or use infrared data on fields
to cross-reference rainfall
and identify vegetation
at risk for drought?

I wish there were a place online
where data science hobbyists
could grab an open question
and submit back their analyses
via literate programming.
I imagine a place like [Github][]
where collaborative people can
"Pull Request" their work
back up to the list
and have it appear
as one of several
attempts at a solution.
We could compare
between the different solutions
and the comment systems
would allow deeper commentary and question
perhaps even resulting in a new line of inquiry.

I'm writing this here
in hopes that by putting it out
into the "ether"
the idea will promulgate
and find root in reality.
I certainly don't have the time or energy
to dedicate to building
such an ecosystem myself.
You,
reading this now,
should go do it for me.
I'll totally use it.

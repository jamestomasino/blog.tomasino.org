Last friday I bought a pair of cross country skis from [REI][]. That
night I went out to one of the trails by my apartment (the place I
usually [frolf][]) to try them out. I made my way about 200 yards and
back before I was completely exhausted and sore all over.

Now, I pick up a lot of hobbies. Many of those I happily abandon after a
few tries, but 200 yards was not going to be my breaking point. So last
night, I suited up again and met up with Emmy to try again. This time I
had an experienced cross country skier with me to show me the ropes. We
made some good progress on fairly flat terrain for about 45 minutes. I'm
really happy about that.

By the end of the run, I was starting to get sloppy because I was so
tired. However, I picked up some better form and made some great
progress. I think I'm going to enjoy this sport.

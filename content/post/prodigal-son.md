<span style="font-style: italic;">Fallen from sonship, beggared of
grace,

Grant me. Father, a servant's place.</span>

    - Christina Rossetti - [A Prodigal Son][] (1902)

My favorite part of the story of the Prodigal Son is the understanding
the father has of the situations that his son has been through which are
never spoken. He knows that he has journeyed, seen amazing and horrible
things, fallen to the lowest depths, and there, alone, made the choice
to come back. We wonder, then, about the other son who stayed with his
father the whole time. Did he stay out of love and understanding, or out
of fear for what was out there? Did he choose his path because of love
or because of selfishness? I really don't know for sure, but the
parallels are clear to me. I see myself in both of those sons at times.
It's long past time to follow the path of the prodigal son. You can't
half-deny God, it doesn't make any sense.

It confuses me more than anything when I see people who know and accept
that God is real, but don't act like it. How can you know it is true and
at the same time deny the implications? How, if you know you are asked
to do something, can you say no? How long can you wander the earth for
your own reasons with your own small interests in the face of that?

In other news, I wrote a riddle today for a friend. I got her a little
present for Christmas and she wanted a hint at what it could be. I spent
a little time looking online for something decent but there's so few
quality riddles there. Instead, I did a little research, opened up a
rhyming dictionary and made the following:

<p>
> <span style="font-style: italic;">One for sorrow,
>
>  Two for joy,
>
>  A rhyme in a riddle
>
>  Is no decoy
>
>  Three for secrets
>
>  known to fly
>
>  A homophone
>
>  Four every pie
>
>  Follow the jay
>
>  And you'll arrive
>
>  amidst the verse
>
>  at the number Five.</span>
> </p>

I talked to some others and they agree that it's a ridiculously hard
riddle. If you want to try it out, I recommend using Google to help. And
keep in mind that the answer is still only a hint at what the present
is. I wasn't going to give it away.

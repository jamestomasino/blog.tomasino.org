It's very easy for me to fall into the little pockets of culture I see
day to day. One of the great blessings of relocating regularly is that
I'm exposed to new pockets, new worlds. Sometimes these are cultures of
incredible beauty, simplicity, nobility, or earnestnes, and other times
they are places of hedonism, rancor, or undeserved righteousness.

Each place is rarely one extreme or the other. For the most part, every
city or town has its mix. In Boston, for instance, I was struck at once
by the beauty and life of the place, but it was overshadowed by a
frightening sense of entitlement and, dare I say it, snobbery. Most of
the others have that type of balance as well.

It's a rare city that makes me feel either totally welcomed or totally
alienated, though recently Atlanta has been threatening to fall into the
later category. Each day I find myself acting a little more cynacal or a
little more angry. This next year will definitely be the last one here.

Luckily, there are some good people here to keep me distracted from the
overwhelming amount of filth and degredation. Good people are worth an
extra year, I think.

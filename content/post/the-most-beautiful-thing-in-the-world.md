In the past I've done a lot of things I'm ashamed of. I've treated some
people very badly, some not so long ago. I've made decisions that have
hurt others, sometimes consciously, but more often because they cared
about something I didn't.

Now I am seeing my mistakes echoed in the life of someone close. For her
the pain is real, it is now, it is everything; and whenever I talk to
her about it, I can't help but feeling the empathy rise to confront me.
When I took advantage or acted without consideration and compassion in
my past it caused this same pain in others. It's something I still ask
forgiveness for.

But seeking forgiveness implies a distance, or at least an end. Can I
ask forgiveness for something I still find myself doing. Can I pull
myself away from who I am and ask forgiveness as if I am already the
person I want to be? Perhaps the answer is yes, and in doing so I take a
step toward changing, or perhaps the answer is no, the seeking of
forgiveness without change is a fallacy and imitation of repentance.
I've thought on it a lot recently, and it led me to a decision.

What kind of person am I to spend my time pondering the value of my own
inaction when there is someone close to me who is suffering from that
same type of disconnection. What kind of friend offers nothing but the
occasional kind word when there is someone in honest need. So for that,
I ask more forgiveness and seek to change. Perhaps I'll wonder about the
merits of this little circular path later.

For now I want to address and offer what little insight I can as an
antagonist to so many. Maybe she'll find something in this to be of real
value, and if not, maybe one of the other few who read this will. If
nothing else, let me make an honest try at being the person I want to be
instead of philosophizing.

I've been blessed to be loved by a few wonderful people. Some of these
are still in my life in some positive way, and I hope I have a similar
role in theirs, but there are others whom I have cut out, or who have
cut out me with great effect. In this group who has gone off in
different directions there are a few who cared for me so much, that when
I, in my indifference, acted without regard to that feeling, I did more
than bruise. Still others--and these are my true shame--I hurt in this
fashion on purpose, knowing that their feelings would make the sting
that much more powerful.

In all of this I was wrong. I acted horribly and hurt people sometimes
just to see them hurt. All of that pain was my fault. It wasn't the
people who loved me who are to blame, but it is they who suffered. I
need to make that point perfectly clear. I can't claim ignorance in any
case, even those caused by indifference. I am responsible.

And so, for you reading, it's not your fault.

The world is full of people who will take advantage of us in our most
vulnerable moments. These people, like me, will hopefully find the
opportunity to see their errors and work to change. In the meantime,
though, all of us should seek to find the strength in ourselves to turn
away from these actions and seek out people with the respect to treat us
as we are. Though we may love and want someone with all our heart and
all our being and all the force we can muster, when we are not respected
and treated with love we absolutely must take a stand. Stop that very
moment and say to the person, say to me, "You treat me like I'm not
human, not worthy of your love." And there, in that moment, look into
their eyes and see if you see it. Is the love there and overlooked, or
is it something else. Is it power to be used.

When I was young, I was trusting and was hurt too. We all go through
something similar, but its in the way we handle these situations that
proves to us who we really are. I was a person scared to be without
power, and so I took on the same role as the person who hurt me. It has
been one of the harder things about myself that I've had to face so far
in my meditations.

Our lives are made up of moments like these where we can suddenly find
ourselves being cruel and jaded, weak and dependent, prideful and full
of vengeance, or perhaps even strong and noble. Sometimes we fall down.
Sometimes we stand up.

There's a beauty though, just beneath the surface of things. It is a
beauty of their being that has nothing to do with action or power or
even love. It is a beauty of existence and relationship that can be
likened to the fearful beauty we feel when we consider the
inplausability of our own existence, the unlikelihood of being here with
each other.

It's the type of stillness of being that is so beautiful that it makes a
kitchen sink seem filled with such wonder that it takes on the
metaphoric mist of heaven. It makes a flower seem more than a collection
of petals and stem. It makes a man or woman who treats us badly as an
unfortunate soul who just doesn't see it all. It makes us fall to our
knees as we are overcome with all of it. The stillness is everything.
The silence is awe.

In those times when things in my life seem so dark that they become
poems with sinister rhyming couplets, and the songs on the radio have
all subscribed to the news-feeds of my life, that's the time when I
force myself to look at it. That's when I look past all of the endless
painful situations I have caused and that I have faced because of others
and all I see is the infinite improbability of creation unraveling in
such pristine, perfect spirals of chance and being, all roads of fate
and time across the universe converging their energies on a cosmic
scale. And there, in the midst of all of this fantastic beauty is the
most beautiful thing in the world. You.

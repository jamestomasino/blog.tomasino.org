FADE IN:

INT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

In the bowels of suburban Indianapolis, coffee percolates and kitchen staff
shout at each other in the distance.

JOSH, international man-of-pancakes, 25 and poised to quit Radio Shack, nods
sagely. JAMES, Italian-American blogging genius extraordinaire, 24 and
nearing grad school, grunts with decision.

                               JAMES
      Are you part of an evil conspiracy to take over the world?

                               JOSH
      Oh yes. The conspiracy is mine.

                               JAMES
      Are you close friends with the man who played Donatello in
      Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: The Secret of the Ooze?

                               JOSH
      You're hot on my trail!

                               JAMES
      ANDY! You are Andy! You are just a head with facial hair
      hiding a complete lack of body.

JOSH hangs his head in defeat.

Somewhere in the early 2000s, Denny's (the breakfast-style restaurant that's not
really a diner but wants to be) sported a Guess Who place mat. My friends and
I took the opportunity to dust off an old house-rule that makes the game
actually fun for adults.

> You are not allowed to ask questions about physical appearance.

That's the crux of it! That little change takes the game from elementary school
to party time. Very quickly your questions devolve into abstract philosophy,
profiling, and silliness.

Take a look at the board below:

![Guess Who][]

One look at Emily and it's obvious that she lost her other earring in a torrid
love affair with Sir Alec Guinness. Chris and Daniel are each other's imaginary
friends. Zachary... he loves you.

Ask your opponent if their character is a Republican, or if they have a secret
shrine to Taylor Swift in their closet. On the one hand it's possible that
you'll disagree on some point or another, but it's actually pretty rare. More
likely you'll end up like Josh and I did, developing intricate and intertwining
backstories for every character that reveal the complex plotting of evil
masterminds. In our game, a large number of these people are dead now. Some of
natural causes, some of imagination, and poor Rachel who died of cancer
complicated by bullets.

Grab the image above and email it to a friend and start a game today!

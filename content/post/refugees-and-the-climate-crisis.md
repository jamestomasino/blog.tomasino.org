According to [The UN Refugee Agency][] there are currently around 103 million
forcibly displaced people around the world. Let's be very clear from the start
that these are not volunteer migrants, but rather people for whom staying in
their homes is not an option. When they show up in another place and ask for
aid they are doing so from necessity.

More than half of those displaced are *internally displaced*, meaning they do
not leave their country of origin. Of those remaining, about 32.5 million are
refugees currently.

This post is about the refugees, but make no mistake, those internally displaced
people are in great need of aid as well, and it's much harder to provide it for
them from afar.

## Current efforts

The European Union has set a relatively open policy on refugees from Ukraine.

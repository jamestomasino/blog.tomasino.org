Here we are in mid-August and the world is still crippled by the global
pandemic. I spoke at length about Iceland's steps to combat COVID-19 in
[my last blog post](/covid-19-in-iceland). Since there have been
a few developments.

{{< figure src="/images/covid-tests-updated.png" caption="Domestic Infection Incident Rate">}}

Iceland "beat" the first wave quickly. People were respectful of the
instructions coming from the leaders here and the distancing rules worked.
We had an extended period with no domestic infection at all and so it was
decided to begin reopening borders. This has been happening slowly,
phasing in more and more locations and with various types of border
screening. We knew that this would bring infection, but the hope was to be
able to quickly identify and contain it when that happened.

More recently that control has slipped and we're witnessing a domestic
spread that's not fully contained. Icelanders returning from abroad seem
to be the biggest issue as they meet friends and family and interact much
more with the community than tourists. We now have infections in several
regions that have been verified to be the same strain and coming from
a single source, but that source hasn't been found.

Our numbers are back up to about ~121 infected and many more in
quarantine. The new travel rules say that everyone entering Iceland will
need to be tested twice and stay in quarantine for several days between
the tests. Sometimes if you are newly infected you can test negative but
still transmit the disease. Thus, if we test you and you are negative we
test you again 5 days later and it should show positive if you were one of
those sneaky cases. Also we're back to the 2-meter rule and for the first
time ever we have a public mask order in effect if you are in a public
place where you can't maintain 2-meters distance.

This time around the locals aren't playing along as well as they could,
sadly. There's quite a few incidents of people having little parties and
such, and each time it's creating little outbreaks. It's nowhere near as
bad as the US is, though. I'm confident we'll get through this latest
iteration soon.

_whitetext was a private livejournal account I kept following a breakup in 2004.
The entries came from a deep depression. They have been recollected here for
data preservation._

it seems so ridiculous to write a story of my day by day here, knowing no one is
reading but me. i most certainly know what happened today, and frankly, in five
years when i look back i definitely wont care. what i may care about, though, is
how i was feeling around this time. i probably wont bother to even read a post
about who said what to whom, nor will my attention be grabbed by the assortment
of foods i was sucking down when my daily drama occurred.

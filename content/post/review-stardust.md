My rating: [4 of 5 stars][]

Short review: I loved it.

Long review: Gaiman's skill at storytelling, the piece that makes his
comics and books such a success, is his voice. I mentioned before that
his book, "American Gods" was one I didn't like, but I respected him a
lot as a writer. Stardust shows why. His tone and voice as a writer walk
a very specific and wonderful line between humorous fantasy and serious
realism. I liken it to the move "The Princess Bride". Everyone knows the
movie is a comedy, but the tone treats its subject seriously... and
that's the magic.

Stardust is a romantic fantasy filled with unicorns, fallen stars,
witches and princes. At the same time, it is a quirksome coming of age
story. The writing is strong. The characters are interesting. The
adventure isn't cliche or the same old expected fare. With all that
going for it the real gem, as I said, is the voice.

I recently learned about the Criterion Challenge. TL;DR - Watch 52 movies in the
year according to a bunch of category themes.


See [the original challenge
post](https://letterboxd.com/benvsthemovies/list/the-criterion-challenge-2025/).

## The Rules

There are 52 categories. The goal is to watch any Criterion released film based
on the categories below between 1/1/25-12/31/25. Your choices can be any films
released by Criterion on 4K, Blu-ray, DVD, VHS, Laserdisc, or ones that have
been featured on The Criterion Channel streaming service.

The films can be watched daily, weekly, or monthly, and in any order! Watch them
at your own pace, but remember you have to finish by 12/31/25.

## Categories & My Picks

I'm going to take the theme to the limit and attempt to watch only films I've
never seen before.

1. [Watch a film from the CC40 Boxset](https://www.criterion.com/boxsets/7646-cc40)

Jules & Jim (1962)

This one is a bit of a cheat since my film club is already watching it this
month. But hey, I'm starting a few weeks late. I need to catch up.

2. Watch a film from the year you were born

Seems Like Old Times (1980)

This was a struggle. I found a list of the top 100 films from 1980 and I've seen
almost all of them. Chevy Chase felt very 1980, and a comedy appeals. I suspect
I won't get too many more of those in this list.

3. [Directed by Robert Altman](https://www.criterion.com/shop/collection/82-robert-altman)

The Player (1992)

I really disliked my Nashville watching experience in film class in college.
I dreaded another super-70s Altman, so I went with this from the 90s.

4. Watch a film that would be your first choice in the Criterion Closet

Barry Lyndon (1975)

This has been on my list forever and I've never gotten to it. I hear it's the
favorite Kubrick for many people. I hope to be in that club.

5. [Great Soundtracks](https://www.criterion.com/shop/collection/110-great-soundtracks)

Thief (1981)

I've seen a lot in this category. James Caan's look on the cover makes me think
the music is going to be pretty solid.

6. [John Turturro’s Adventures in
   Moviegoing](https://letterboxd.com/criterion/list/john-turturros-adventures-in-moviegoing-criterion/)

Divorzio all'italiana (1961)

The description makes this sound like it's gonna be a good watch. Critique of
Italian social norms and the disconnect from morality. Neat!

7. 1920s

Speedy (1928)

This sounds like it has all the hallmarks of a good time.

8. [Watch a film that will be added to the physical collection in
   2025](https://www.criterion.com/shop/browse?popular=coming-soon)

Ugetsu (1953)

One of the filmmakers that influenced Kurosawa? Sure thing!

9. 1930s

Zero for Conduct (1933)

Vigo's only feature film.

10. [Andrew Garfield’s Closet
    Picks](https://letterboxd.com/closetpicks/list/andrew-garfields-criterion-closet-picks/)

The Red Shoes (1948)

This one is already waiting on my Plex server. So many five-star ratings all
over it.

11. 1940s

Gaslight (1946)

I've also been sitting on this one waiting to watch it with a friend. We keep
forgetting and forgetting. Now is the time.

12. [Celine Song’s Top
    10](https://www.criterion.com/current/top-10-lists/567-celine-song-s-top-10)

Pina (2011)

I adore Wim Wenders, so I'm willing to take a ride with him to places I normally
wouldn't. A documentary about a choreographer? Sure!

13. 1950s

Night of the Hunter (1955)

Film noir horror? Yes please.

14. [Watch a film from the Criterion Channel’s all time favorites
    lists](https://www.criterionchannel.com/all-time-favorites)

Godland (2022)

An Iceland film? How did I miss this one? Sounds fantastic.

15. 1960s

Persona (1966)

Bergman playing with visual poetry.

16. [Watch a film that is currently out of print from the physical
    collection](https://www.criterion.com/shop/browse?popular=out-of-print)

Forbidden Games (1952)

The cover image caught my attention. I know nothing about this one.

17. 1970s

Aguirre: The Wrath of God (1972)

Herzog plus grueling on-location shoot that put strains on the cast and
production. It's going to be an experience.

18. [William Friedkin’s Closet
    Picks](https://letterboxd.com/closetpicks/list/william-friedkins-criterion-closet-picks/)

All That Money Can Buy (1941)

Faust!

19. 1980s

Streetwise (1984)

This year my film club has a focus on documentaries. I may be able to work this
one into one of our months. It looks to capture the feeling of gen X in a really
visceral way, through the lost runaways in Seattle. Latchkey without a home to
go back to.

20. [Spine
    #451-499](https://www.criterion.com/shop/browse/list?sort=spine_number)

The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1965)

I really enjoyed the John le Carré book. I'm curious how this b+w film will take
on the story.

21. 1990s

Raise the Red Lantern (1991)

I found a [Rotten Tomatoes list of the top 140 films of the
decade](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/140-favorite-90s-movies/) and
there were only 4 I haven't seen already. Yikes!

22. Documentary

20 Feet From Stardom (2013)

This sounds really engaging. A tribute to backup singers. I love things that
shine a spotlight on the underappreciated.

23. 2000s

A Prophet (2009)

French gangster film, and the highest rated of the decade I haven't seen.

24. [Janus
    Contemporaries](https://letterboxd.com/jbutts15/list/janus-contemporaries/)

Tori et Lokita (2022)

I think this one is gonna break me.

25. 2010s

A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (2019)

Mr Rodgers! Except not. It's the story of Lloyd Vogel and we intersect with Mr.
Rodgers throughout. I just watched this one last weekend and it was so
beautiful. Many tears were shed and I love everything about what Mr. Rogers
stood for even more now.

26. [Bill Hader’s Second Closet
    Picks](https://letterboxd.com/closetpicks/list/bill-haders-second-criterion-closet-picks/)

Petite Maman (2021)

Coming to terms with loss, familial ties, and a sense of freedom from
existential sadness. Can't wait.

27. 2020s

TÁR (2022)

I missed this when all my friends were watching and loving it. Time to catch up.

28. [Noir and
    Neonoir](https://www.criterion.com/shop/collection/17-noir-and-neonoir)

Leave Her to Heaven (1945)

I have seen so many noir films and loved them all. This one isn't in my
collection, but had a cool poster.

29. [All Time Top Criterion Closet
    Picks](https://letterboxd.com/closetpicks/list/all-time-top-criterion-closet-picks/)

Harakiri (1962)

There are so many Godzilla films in this list that I wish I could pick, but I've
watched them all with my son. So instead I'll pick something else from Japan.

30. [Criterion Releases Never Picked in the
    Closet](https://letterboxd.com/closetpicks/list/criterion-releases-never-picked-in-the-closet/)

The Third Man (1949)

This has been sitting in my collection for a really long time and it's a shame
I haven't gotten to it yet.

31. North American film

Birdman (2014)

This looks really good and I meant to see it years ago.

32. [Ayo Edebiri’s Closet
    Picks](https://letterboxd.com/closetpicks/list/ayo-edebiris-criterion-closet-picks/)

High and Low (1963)

Kurosawa and Mifune. How can you go wrong?

33. [Wim Wenders’ Adventures in
    Moviegoing](https://www.criterionchannel.com/wim-wenders-adventures-in-moviegoing)

The Munekata Sisters (1950)

An Ozu film.

34. South American film

No (2012)

Fighting a dictator with joy. I think I could use this right now.

35. Random Number Generator (Google random number generator, set values from
    1 to whatever number [Criterion has listed last
    here](https://www.criterion.com/shop/browse/list?sort=spine_number). This
    number will change as more releases are announced so please keep up to date
    by using the link I have provided as I will not be updating each time
    Criterion makes announcements. Watch whatever movie corresponds to the spine
    number you are given.)

Drylongso (1998)

Random number 1190

36. [AAPI
    Filmmakers](https://www.criterion.com/shop/collection/547-celebrate-aapi-filmmakers)

Man Push Cart (2005)

The concept caught my eye.

37. Watch a film shorter than 80 minutes

Bad Black (2016)

So difficult to get films from Africa in these things. This looks wild. Low
budget action comedy!

38. European film

8½ (1963)

It's time I watch this classic.

39. Cult Movies

Ganja & Hess (1973)

I actually have this sitting in my collection already. It looks glorious.

40. [Isabella Rossellini’s Adventures in
    Moviegoing](https://www.criterionchannel.com/isabella-rossellini-s-adventures-in-moviegoing)

La Strada (1954)

Fellini in a beauty & the beast interpretation? Sounds intriguing.

41. [Winona Ryder’s Closet
    Picks](https://letterboxd.com/closetpicks/list/winona-ryders-criterion-closet-picks/)

The Killing of a Chinese Bookie (1976)

This didn't interest me at all, but it's in Winona's list, so I'm going for it.

42. African film

Tsotsi (2005)

I went down this path looking for good African films last year. This is one
I haven't gotten to yet but has solid reviews.

43. [John Carpenter’s Top
    10](https://www.criterion.com/current/top-10-lists/643-john-carpenter-s-top-10)

Only Angels Have Wings (1939)

The review I read sold me.

44. Horror

The Innocents (1961)

Gothic horror at its finest!

45. Asian film

Yi Yi (2000)

A bunch of people on Reddit say it's their favorite of all time. Gotta trust the
strangers.

46. [Dark Comedies](https://www.criterion.com/shop/collection/324-dark-comedies)

The Worst Person in the World (2021)

I almost picked this for another category. It looks great.

47. [Rachel Kushner’s Adventures in
    Moviegoing](https://www.criterionchannel.com/rachel-kushner-s-adventures-in-moviegoing)

The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976)

Lets be honest. This is for David Bowie.

48. Australian film

Chopper (2000)

I've long had this on my list of quintessential Aussie films to watch. It's
waiting for me on Plex already.

49. [Female
    Filmmakers](https://www.criterion.com/shop/collection/501-female-filmmakers)

Smooth Talk (1985)

This was the most extreme 80s cover image I've ever seen. It looks like it
should be a Hall & Oates album. Yes, I'm picking this because of a silly
picture. Maybe it'll be good too.

50. [Ben Wheatley’s Closet
    Picks](https://letterboxd.com/closetpicks/list/ben-wheatleys-criterion-closet-picks/)

Rumble Fish (1983)

Ahh! All the Zatoichi films, but I've already binged them. Curses. That would
have been fun. I've seen most of these on the list, actually. My choices were
this or Sweet Smell of Success (1957). I'm going with the 80s gang wars.

51. A film by a director whose work you have not seen before

Ishtar (1987)

This is a really hard category. How do you even find directors you haven't seen
before? What do I search? I went with women directors, found Elaine May, and
thought I had a winner. But it looks like her best rated stuff she didn't
direct, but instead wrote. I was reading the list aloud and Leah said, "Ishtar
was directed by a woman? Wasn't that one of the worst films ever made? You have
to pick that one." So here we are.

52. Watch any Criterion film from your watchlist

Night on Earth (1991)

I don't use Letterboxed, but I do have a watchlist on Plex & Trakt!

---

Well then. That was a lot. It took me almost 3 hours to put that together.
Yikes! Now to get watching.

I recently learned about the Criterion Challenge. TL;DR - Watch 52 movies in the
year according to a bunch of category themes.


See [the original challenge
post](https://letterboxd.com/benvsthemovies/list/the-criterion-challenge-2025/).

## The Rules

There are 52 categories. The goal is to watch any Criterion released film based
on the categories below between 1/1/25-12/31/25. Your choices can be any films
released by Criterion on 4K, Blu-ray, DVD, VHS, Laserdisc, or ones that have
been featured on The Criterion Channel streaming service.

The films can be watched daily, weekly, or monthly, and in any order! Watch them
at your own pace, but remember you have to finish by 12/31/25.

## Categories & My Picks

I'm going to take the theme to the limit and attempt to watch only films I've
never seen before.

1. [Watch a film from the CC40 Boxset](https://www.criterion.com/boxsets/7646-cc40)

Jules & Jim (1962)

This one is a bit of a cheat since my film club is already watching it this
month. But hey, I'm starting a few weeks late. I need to catch up.

2. Watch a film from the year you were born

Seems Like Old Times (1980)

This was a struggle. I found a list of the top 100 films from 1980 and I've seen
almost all of them. Chevy Chase felt very 1980, and a comedy appeals. I suspect
I won't get too many more of those in this list.

3. [Directed by Robert Altman](https://www.criterion.com/shop/collection/82-robert-altman)

The Player (1992)

I really disliked my Nashville watching experience in film class in college.
I dreaded another super-70s Altman, so I went with this from the 90s.

4. Watch a film that would be your first choice in the Criterion Closet

Barry Lyndon (1975)

This has been on my list forever and I've never gotten to it. I hear it's the
favorite Kubrick for many people. I hope to be in that club.

5. [Great Soundtracks](https://www.criterion.com/shop/collection/110-great-soundtracks)

Thief (1981)

I've seen a lot in this category. James Caan's look on the cover makes me think
the music is going to be pretty solid.

6. [John Turturro’s Adventures in
   Moviegoing](https://letterboxd.com/criterion/list/john-turturros-adventures-in-moviegoing-criterion/)

Divorzio all'italiana (1961)

The description makes this sound like it's gonna be a good watch. Critique of
Italian social norms and the disconnect from morality. Neat!

7. 1920s

Speedy (1928)

This sounds like it has all the hallmarks of a good time.

8. [Watch a film that will be added to the physical collection in
   2025](https://www.criterion.com/shop/browse?popular=coming-soon)

Ugetsu (1953)

One of the filmmakers that influenced Kurosawa? Sure thing!

9. 1930s

Zero for Conduct (1933)

Vigo's only feature film.

10. [Andrew Garfield’s Closet
    Picks](https://letterboxd.com/closetpicks/list/andrew-garfields-criterion-closet-picks/)

The Red Shoes (1948)

This one is already waiting on my Plex server. So many five-star ratings all
over it.

11. 1940s

Gaslight (1946)

I've also been sitting on this one waiting to watch it with a friend. We keep
forgetting and forgetting. Now is the time.

12. [Celine Song’s Top
    10](https://www.criterion.com/current/top-10-lists/567-celine-song-s-top-10)

Pina (2011)

I adore Wim Wenders, so I'm willing to take a ride with him to places I normally
wouldn't. A documentary about a choreographer? Sure!

13. 1950s

Night of the Hunter (1955)

Film noir horror? Yes please.

14. [Watch a film from the Criterion Channel’s all time favorites
    lists](https://www.criterionchannel.com/all-time-favorites)

Godland (2022)

An Iceland film? How did I miss this one? Sounds fantastic.

15. 1960s

Persona (1966)

Bergman playing with visual poetry.

16. [Watch a film that is currently out of print from the physical
    collection](https://www.criterion.com/shop/browse?popular=out-of-print)

Forbidden Games (1952)

The cover image caught my attention. I know nothing about this one.

17. 1970s

Aguirre: The Wrath of God (1972)

Herzog plus grueling on-location shoot that put strains on the cast and
production. It's going to be an experience.

18. [William Friedkin’s Closet
    Picks](https://letterboxd.com/closetpicks/list/william-friedkins-criterion-closet-picks/)

All That Money Can Buy (1941)

Faust!

19. 1980s

Streetwise (1984)

This year my film club has a focus on documentaries. I may be able to work this
one into one of our months. It looks to capture the feeling of gen X in a really
visceral way, through the lost runaways in Seattle. Latchkey without a home to
go back to.

20. [Spine
    #451-499](https://www.criterion.com/shop/browse/list?sort=spine_number)

The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1965)

I really enjoyed the John le Carré book. I'm curious how this b+w film will take
on the story.

21. 1990s

Raise the Red Lantern (1991)

I found a [Rotten Tomatoes list of the top 140 films of the
decade](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/140-favorite-90s-movies/) and
there were only 4 I haven't seen already. Yikes!

<span style="font-style: italic;">The perfect stillness of the night was
thrilled by a more solemn silence. The darkness held a presence that was
all the more felt because it was not seen. I could not any more have
doubted that HE was there than that I was. Indeed, I felt myself to be,
if possible, the less real of the two.</span>

    - W. James - [The Varieties of Religious Experience][] (1902)

Last night I was taking more notes on Rudolf Otto's book, <span
style="text-decoration:underline">The Idea of the Holy</span>, when I
came upon this quote from William James' work. It is the quote of a
clergyman taken from the manuscripts of Edwin D. Starbuck, of Stanford
University. It's quite the path leading back to the original quote, but
it summed up so much that I wanted to say that I had to track it down.
In all the researching I've been doing both for my book that I toy with
endlessly and for my own personal discernment, I keep running into the
same themes again and again; themes of <span
style="font-style: italic;">heirophany</span> that speak to me on a very
personal level.

The root of my religious choices have been a series of experiences that
I thought were unique for a very long time. When I was in Jr. High
School, I found it hard to believe that other people could have similar
feelings, or experience what I was experiencing. These days, I seem to
have the opposite problem. Having found so many similar people in my
life, I find it hard to comprehend those people who have never felt the
feeling of religious ecstasy, witnessed the <span
style="font-style: italic;">mysterium tremendum</span>, or come face to
face with the ineffible truth of their being, "I am nothing, YOU are
everything."

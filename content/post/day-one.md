I'm sitting at a beautiful airbnb in Reykjavík across from my fabulous
wife while my son flips through some activity books on the couch. We're
all tired, sweaty, hungry, and did I mention tired? Above all, though,
we're Icelandic residents. (Well, 2/3)

Two weeks ago things really hit their stride. As I talked about in my last
post, we had the apartment packed up and coordinated a fancy-dance of
movers from our storage unit to the apartment to a shipping container.
Remarkably, the timing all worked perfectly and we made it happen. The
majority of our household goods are in a container up in Saco, Maine
waiting until later in the month to ship to Iceland. By that time we hope
to have an apartment rented where we can get things delivered.

After the packing shenanigans we spent a night with friends and then a few
more nights cleaning out the apartment. Giving back those keys felt like
more of a milestone than the packing did, somehow. We also sold my car to
a friend and sold my wife's lease back to the dealership, though at some
cost. That wasn't great, but it's done.

Finally, we all went to see Toy Story 4 with friends to celebrate
a birthday for my godson. It was cute. We couldn't stick around much
afterward, though. Saturday morning started the trek to Calabash.

For our first leg of the drive we went down to Washington, DC and met up
with an old college friend, Doug, and his family. I haven't seen Doug
since I left Indiana, so that was a real treat. We caught up on his life
and ours and had some insanely good food at the Silver Diner. On full
tummys we loaded back up and drove on.

In the end we spent about 13 hours on the road getting to my parent's
house. We made it early enough to spend a little time with them that night
in addition to the next day. It was too short a visit, but it's all that
could be squeezed in, unfortunately. It was good to see Mom and Dad and
let Wit play with them a bit.

The following Monday we made our way to Charlotte and rented a long-term
storage unit. It's a pretty cool one that's inside these long hallways
that all look the same. When our shipping pod showed up the next day
everything fit nicely. We spent a few days saying goodbye to friends and
family there as well, including a nice party with most of Leah's family.

On June 30th we were finally ready for the big trip. I'm a little bit
crazy when I travel so we ended up at the airport about 5 hours early and
squatted in line at the Jet Blue counter in Charlotte. Our first flight
was at 4 p.m. taking us to Boston where we'd then have a 2-hour layover
and then a 5 hour flight to Keflavík. An hour and a half later, once the
counter opened, we found out that big bag was too heavy to be allowed on
IcelandAir's plane at all! OH NOES. So we sat there in the middle of the
check-in area and swapped heavy things around between bags to even out the
weight. We had a small upcharge for the heavy bag, but we were moving
again. Sadly, our plan to bring Wit's car booster seat was for naught as
it was too wide for the throw-away bag we'd prepared for it. I hope some
lucky person at the Enterprise car rental in Charlotte picked it up.

The flights themselves were a blur. Wit and Leah got a bit of sleep
in on the longer flight, and the attendants were cool. I love
IcelandAir.

6 a.m., July 1st we touched down in Keflavík. We haven't been to that
airport in 3 years and boy has it grow up. It's easily the best airport
I've even been to. The bathroom is made up of individual private rooms.
The sinks have the water, soap, and dyson dryer thing all integrated in
one spot. You put your hands in the middle to wash and move them outward
to the side and they dry. It's magic. Next up, customs…

I prepped our brand new Italian passports and we walked into the EU line,
which was totally empty. As we approached the self-check-in kiosk
a security worker waved us through the family line. We walked up to the
window, showed our passports and got a "Welcome to Iceland" about
3 seconds later. That was easy!

Since we had so many bags and aren't too familiar with the bus system we
decided to rent a car for a few days to get settled. Car rentals in
Iceland are mostly manual transmissions, with the automatics costing much,
much more. The thing is, I drove my friend's stick shift in high school
a few times and that's about it. Wow do I suck at it. I stalled about 11
times getting it around to pick up Leah and Wit but then I managed to make
it all the way from the airport to the Residency Office without stalling
again.

Living in Iceland as an EU citizen requires that we register with the
Residency Office. There's an online form with a bunch of documents needed
that we filled out from Charlotte, but the real processing doesn't happen
until you show up in person. We got to the office around 8:30 and they
opened at 9, so we camped out at the door. It's a good thing, too. When
the door opened there were about 25 people in line behind us.

We met with a nice woman at the counter who asked for a few things
that we had also prepared. She scanned a few docs and got Leah to sign
a letter and we were done. The biggest hurdle, and the one that had me the
most worried, was over. Despite the aid of a lawyer and checking the
document requirements a hundred times I still worried we were going to
show up and they were going to say "no." What a relief. As we were leaving
they informed us that in a few days we'd be getting an email about the
results.

I called out host at the airbnb and he said the place was ready so we went
straight over to decompress. A few days passed…and by that I mean an hour.
That's right, 1 hour later we got the emails with our kennitala. Wit and
I are officially residents of Iceland.

For the rest of day one we had some snacks, took a nap, walked to the
local supermarket and got a few bits to survive. We cooked dinner and
walked through the park. Wit discovered a playground filled with kids and
families having cookouts so we hung around and helped him play. They even
had a zip-line.

It's now 9 p.m. and Wit is getting a bath before we send him off to bed.
We're all still extremely tired from the travel but we're relieved to have
the hardest parts behind us. I think I'm going to sleep damn well tonight.

There's been a lot of talk lately about "The Cloud". There's lots of new
products out there touting their ability to store your info in it, move
all your applications to it, make your life better through it. I wanted
to post this really quick message to dispel some myths.

First, the term "The Cloud" is almost meaningless now. Advertisers have
stretched its definition to the point where it's basically synonymous
with "The Internet". Second, all these Cloud Apps you hear about:
they're websites. Yup, that's all. Finally, despite the annoying
rebranding, "The Cloud" (in it's original meaning) is actually very
useful. One of the biggest uses you can all take advantage of right now
is storage space on the cloud.

Cloud storage is, like any cloud app, a website. There are many to
choose from, and there's no reason to choose just one. Below is a list
of websites that offer free space to store your stuff. My favorites are
listed first. It doesn't matter what operating system you use, how old
your computer is, or what browser you're using (unless it's [IE6][]).
Pop over, sign up, reap the benefits of having your files backed up
online, easily shared or secured, and synced between all your computers
(even at work).

Remember, all of these offer a "free" option. If you don't see it at
first, keep looking. Some of them like to hide the link or make it
smaller than the pay links.
